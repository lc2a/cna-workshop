# Lab 2 
Lab2 shows a monolithic application for ACME Inc.
The application has simple UI that takes user account information and provides most suitable stock to invest.
Of course, it is based on highly sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms. 
You get it, right? ;)

The monolith includes UI layer, business logic and the API all together in the same app.
